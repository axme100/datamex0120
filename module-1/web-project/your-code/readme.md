# Web project
For this project I scraped the official campaign pages in Spanish of different democratic senators for the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.

- The file articles.py is the meat of the project, it contains all of the functions that scrape the candidates' pages. I also spent some time connecting to the twitter api (see twitter.py) as well as testing out the RSS feed of pa√≠s. I didn't actually use any data for these last two resources.
